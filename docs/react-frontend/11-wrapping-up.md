## Next steps

Now that you have a working application, you can continue to build on it. Here are some ideas:

- Update the UI whenever _anyone_ mints.
- Add a gallery to display all minted NFTs.
- Integrate with a marketplace so users can view their tokens there.
- Integrate with PYUSD.to so the owner can offramp their PYUSD to fiat.
