# Welcome to _Build with PYUSD_

We're excited to have you here! We've built this site as a community resource for builders using [PYUSD](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto/pyusd). Here you'll find guides, sample projects, and resources to help you get started building with PYUSD.

## ðŸ¦¾ Real projects

We've created some real world projects that use PYUSD, and these guides will walk you through building them yourself.

The projects we've featured here are examples of what you can build with PYUSD. We've provided working sample projects and deployments to get you started. Feel free to remix, reuse, or contribute back to the community.
