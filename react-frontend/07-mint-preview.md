#### `MintPreview.tsx`

We'll build this as a relatively simple `<div>` that is square and displays the image of the next token to be minted.

We'll create a separate subcomponent, `TokenImage`, to handle the image display.

You should now see a preview of the token you're about to mint in your app!
