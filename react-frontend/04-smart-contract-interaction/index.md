## Interact with the smart contract

We're now ready to interact with a smart contract that accepts PYUSD, as well as the PYUSD contract itself.

We'll use the ERC721 smart contract we created in our other walkthrough. On Sepolia, we have this contract deployed at `0xc32ef01341487792201F6EFD908aB52CDC7b0775` (though you can use your own if you like).
